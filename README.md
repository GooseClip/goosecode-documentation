# About

## Mission

To help understand and communicate complex software projects.&#x20;

## Motivation

Reasoning about code in tabbed code editors is difficult and lacks the structural information and enrichment necessary to fully communicate how parts of the codebase co-exist.&#x20;

## A new age of coding

With the advent of AI, writing code has never been easier... and reading it has never been harder. GooseCode was born out of the changing landscape of software development over the past few years, with a goal to be a companion to advancing code generating tools.

{% hint style="info" %}
GooseCode is not a AI driven platform - we help you understand your code
{% endhint %}

## What is it?

GooseCode is a canvas application designed specifically for the purpose of understanding code. With version 2.0 we're introducing IDE integration (vscode / cursor initially) to generate flows by clicking through your codebase. GooseCode also includes a number of coding utilities to reduce the need to context switch while working.&#x20;

## What is it not?

The goal is not to be another IDE, and for this reason we've chosen to not to prioritize code writing tooling. Instead you can source exiting code from GitHub or your support IDE extension, create notes, diagram, infer relationships to better communicate what the code is doing.&#x20;

## Who is it for?

If you're a software developer, tester, code reviewer or lead/architect/CTO, GooseCode is for you.

## Pricing

### Free always

{% hint style="success" %}
GooseCode is FREE
{% endhint %}

GooseCode is a **free first** tool and the core features will always be free.

We all know great products that were ruined by aggressive monetization and we don't want that to be the case with GooseCode.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Existing free features available in GooseCode version 2.0 will never become premium
{% endhint %}

### A word on the future

That being said, modern products cost money to run, and for a high quality product you need a skilled, dedicated team developing new features and fixing bugs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
By introducing premium plans we finance the continued development of the _always free_ feature sets of the app.
{% endhint %}

#### Quotas and limits

We may need to enforce quotas or limits to prevent abuse in certain situations.

#### Premium features

In the future we may introduce new premium features which bring a high amount of value.

#### How will we determine what is premium

* If it delivers a high amount of value beyond basic functionality, we will probably charge for it.
* If it requires significant resources to support after initial development, we will probably charge for it.&#x20;
* If its a niche feature not used by most users, we will probably charge for it.
* If it is targeted towards organizations, we will most likely charge for it.
* If it costs us to run, we will have to charge for it.

#### Examples of premium features

* Collaboration features & sharing (w/ a free tier limited model).
* Large media e.g. videos.
* Advanced utilities e.g. e2e encrypted sending, MCP integrations.
* Integrations with third-party products.
* Organizations & members.
* Organization security features, e.g. SAML, MFA.
