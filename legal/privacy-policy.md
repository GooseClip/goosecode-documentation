### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data

In the process of providing our Service, we may require you to furnish us with specific personally identifiable information that can be employed to contact or identify you. We collect and process the following types of personal data:

1. **User IDs**: A unique identifier, or User ID, is created for each user by Firebase Authentication during account creation. This User ID is used to associate data with individual users within our Service. User IDs are stored securely and are only used for the purposes outlined in this policy.
2. **Email address**: We collect your email address when you authenticate using Firebase Authentication with Apple OAuth2 Login. This is the only personal data we collect during the authentication process.&#x20;

This information could include, but is not limited to, the operating system version and build number, locale, device manufacturer and model, screen dimensions, connection status, and root status.

This device information may be associated with your User ID to help us improve our Service and provide a better user experience by tailoring our Service to the general characteristics of our users' devices.

We use third-party services which may also use this device information:

* **Sentry** uses device information for diagnostic purposes, helping us identify and resolve technical issues and improve the stability of our Service.
* **RevenueCat** uses device information to process payment transactions securely.

Please note that these third-party services have their own privacy policies governing their use of data, which we recommend you review.

4. **Diagnostic Data**: Sentry is used for crash reporting, which includes device information, allowing us to troubleshoot issues and improve the stability of our Service. Any IP addresses in the diagnostic data are scrubbed to ensure your privacy. If you wish, you can opt out of this data collection via the app settings.
5. **Country Information**: During a payment transaction, RevenueCat records your country, which is determined using your IP address. However, the IP address is not stored after this information has been obtained. This country information helps us understand our user demographic and is necessary for transaction and tax purposes.
6. **GitHub Data**: In order to authenticate your user account and enhance the functionality of our Service, we may access and store information related to your GitHub account, if you opt to connect it. This data may include, but is not limited to, your GitHub username, associated repositories, files contained within those repositories, repository ownership details, and other associated data. Please note, we only collect and process this data with your explicit consent, and in compliance with GitHub's terms and conditions, as well as applicable privacy laws and regulations. If you have concerns about the scope of data access, you have the option to create a fine-grained access token within GitHub. This token allows you to specify and limit the data our Service can access, providing you with greater control over your data privacy.&#x20;
7. **IDE Integration**: Our Service offers an optional IDE Integration feature, which allows the Application to connect with your computer. Upon your explicit authorization, this feature will have access to files located within the IDE workspace. This access is necessary to provide certain functionalities of our Service, such as code reading and editing functionality, error checking, and others. The Application will not transmit these files to our servers or use them for any purpose other than providing the features of our Service. Encrypted caches of files used within the canvas, will be stored locally on your Device.

We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of your personal data. We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.
