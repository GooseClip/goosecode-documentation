# FAQs

## Why is GooseCode not a browser application?

The goal of GooseCode is to have a seamless integration with your operating system. By choosing not to implement GooseCode as a browser application, we can do really interesting things like creating overlays and minimaps which would otherwise not be possible. Were also incredibly security conscious and dont want certain things to be internet-connected, such as the tooling in the Toolbox.

## What is Version 2?

GooseCode version 2 as a desktop, cloud native solution, which focuses on collaboration and IDE integration. It is geared towards the evolving developer flows using AI coding tooling. GooseCode 2 will continue to evolve and we do not expect a version 3.

## What happened to Version 1?

GooseCode was originally designed as an iPad application. It was specifically designed for the iPad operating system and didnt use cloud syncing functionality as a first class citizen. As a result we are largely unable to recover the data from version 1 so version 2 stands alone and is a breaking change. If you wish to continue to use version 1 it will be available for some time, but support has stopped.&#x20;

## Why do I need to log in to GitHub so many times?

Places where you might need to log in to GitHub:&#x20;

* Authentication / Sign In Screen
* GitHub Pane in Canvas
* WebView Pane in Canvas

All three serve different purposes:

* Sign In - Only for identity
* GitHub Pane - For accessing repository data e.g. code (you can use fine-grained tokens also).&#x20;
* WebView Pane - For secure access to your account if desired.&#x20;
